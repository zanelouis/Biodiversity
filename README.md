# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview 
We are helping Roza create a dashboard to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Project
We will use HTML, Javascript and d3 to create a website with a dashboard, filters and plotly to visualize the data for our audience.
